- Unauthorized access or credential compromise
- Data loss or exfiltration
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Insider threats or policy violations
- Misconfiguration and human error

---

## 4. Incident Response Lifecycle  
_(Based on NIST 800-61 Rev. 2 & ISO 27035)_

### 🧰 Phase 1: Preparation
- Maintain updated IR playbooks and contact lists
- Implement SIEM/SOAR monitoring systems (e.g., Splunk, QRadar)
- Train staff on recognizing and reporting incidents

### 🔍 Phase 2: Detection & Analysis
- Identify IOCs via log analysis, threat intel, and user reports
- Classify incidents using a standardized severity matrix
- Initiate incident ticketing in the ITSM platform

### 🔐 Phase 3: Containment
- Isolate compromised systems (quarantine, network segmentation)
- Deactivate affected accounts or credentials
- Document affected assets and timeline for forensics

### 🧼 Phase 4: Eradication & Recovery
- Remove malware/backdoors, reimage infected hosts
- Apply patches or reconfigure systems
- Recover from backups after verifying system integrity
- Resume business operations in phased manner

### 📘 Phase 5: Lessons Learned
- Conduct post-incident reviews within 10 business days
- Generate root cause analysis (RCA) and report to senior management
